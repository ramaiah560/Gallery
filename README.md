## Introduction
`Image Gallery with Modal and Category Filters` is a simple web-based gallery that allows you to filter images by categories (e.g., Nature, Architecture, Animals), view images in full-screen mode with captions, and easily navigate through different images. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

This gallery can be used to showcase collections of images, whether for portfolios, personal projects, or general media displays.

# Getting started & controls
Thank you for checking out the `Image Gallery with Modal and Category Filters` project! Once you open the `index.html` file, you'll see a gallery with images categorized into different sections. You can filter the gallery by clicking the filter buttons at the top of the page (e.g., Nature, Architecture, Animals). Clicking an image will open it in a full-screen modal view, displaying the image with a caption below.

# How It Works
- The gallery contains several categories (e.g., Nature, Architecture, Animals).
- Each image is clickable and opens a modal with a larger view and a caption.
- The filtering functionality is implemented with JavaScript, allowing you to view only images from a specific category.

# Instructions within the Application
Detailed instructions and tooltips are embedded within the application to help guide you through the experience. Simply click on the filter buttons to view different categories of images. Clicking an image will open the full-screen modal with the caption displayed.

# Roadmap
Upcoming features to be implemented:
- [ ] Add more categories (e.g., Food, Travel)
- [ ] Implement infinite scroll for loading more images dynamically
- [ ] Mobile enhancements for better performance
- [ ] Add image descriptions and metadata
- [ ] Option to upload images directly through the interface
- [ ] Image carousel for browsing images in modal

# How to Run a Development Copy of the Project
